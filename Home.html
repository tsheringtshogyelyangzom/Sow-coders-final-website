    <p>Biodiversity is essential to Bhutan's environment, culture, economy, and societal well-being. The protection of biodiversity is not just an environmental issue but is directly tied to the country's national identity, spiritual beliefs, and commitment to sustainable development. Bhutan's unique approach to conservation—coupled with its strong policies, such as maintaining high forest cover and adopting green growth principles—demonstrates the importance of biodiversity as both a resource and a responsibility for the nation and the world.</p>
     <h2>What is Biodiversity</h2>
    <p>Biodiversity is all the different kinds of life you'll find in one area—the variety of animals, plants, fungi, and even microorganisms like bacteria that make up our natural world. Each of these species and organisms work together in ecosystems, like an intricate web, to maintain balance and support life</p>
